          <b> Information Problem: </b> Helping people figure out what classes they
          should take after the transition to online.

          <b> What We Do: </b> We provide UMD INST undergrad students a way to see the
          GPA trends for all of their classes <br> and sections from the past 3
          semesters, since COVID forced us all to study online in Fall 2020. If we notice a <br>
          significant shift in the GPA, the student is warned via the Trending Down label
          so that they're prepared to take <br> a class that doesn't have good results virtually (if they
          still choose to).
