          Information Problem: Helping people figure out what classes they
          should take after the transition to online. <br />
          What we do: We provide UMD INST Undergrad students a way to see the
          GPA trends for all of their classes and sections from the past 3
          semesters (since COVID forced us to be online). If we notice a large
          shift in the GPA, we warn the student about it in order to make sure
          they get a good schedule.
